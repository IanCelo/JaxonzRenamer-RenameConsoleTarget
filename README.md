# JaxonzRenamerFollowerFix

A simple fix to JaxonzRenamer bug when renamed follower would lose their name and the ability to be talked to and interact with.

## Installation

Nexus Mod:
- drag the .zip
- install and enable
- deploy mods
- load AFTER JaxonzRenamer

(I only use Nexus so I don't know how you do it with other Mod Managers)


Manually: 
- extract the files to the "Skyrim Special Edition/Data" folder
- replace the JaxonzRenamer files when asked to (jaxonzrenamer.psc in scripts/source and jaxonzrenamer.pex in scripts)


## How it works

This adds the posibility to rename an object selected by console (you can still rename as before too).
Just open the console, click on the target, close the console, type the renaming key and rename.
