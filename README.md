# JaxonzRenamerFollowerFix

A simple fix to JaxonzRenamer bug when renamed follower would lose their name and the ability to be talked to and interact with.

## Installation

Nexus Mod:
- drag the .zip
- install and enable
- deploy mods
- load AFTER JaxonzRenamer

(I only use Nexus so I don't know how you do it with other Mod Managers)


Manually: 
- extract the files to the "Skyrim Special Edition/Data" folder
- replace the JaxonzRenamer files when asked to (jaxonzrenamer.psc in scripts/source and jaxonzrenamer.pex in scripts)
